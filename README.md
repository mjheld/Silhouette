# Silhouette

By: Matthew Held

Silhouette is a game that tests your ability to rotate a figure in 3D space. The better spatial recognition skills you have, the farther you will progress! The game starts with a single cube and each round a new cube will spawn off the main structure. Your goal each round is to rotate the structure to fit into the silhouette shown on the screen. How many rounds will you be able to get correct in a row?

## Motivation

I created this game to learn more about 3D graphics programming as well as the structure of a video game.

## Installation

Simply download the project and open Silhouette.html using your favorite browser. Hope you enjoy! :)
